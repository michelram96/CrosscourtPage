<h1 class="news"> One step at a time paramount for Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal</h1>
<p class="news">
PARIS -- After two days of rain, they finally made their French Open debuts on the Roland Garros show courts that sit not more than 200 yards apart. With little to no resistance, they then waltzed through their first-round matches with the ease you expect from two men who have 25 Grand Slam singles titles between them.

Rafael Nadal wore his usual scowling game face and was all business during his brisk, utterly dominant win against Australia's hulking Sam Groth. And Novak Djokovic blazed to a straight-sets win against Yen-Hsun Lu of Taipei, then spoke to the Philippe Chatrier crowd in French during his postmatch talk and left everyone charmed, as usual.

It was hardly indicative of the stiffer tests that should lay ahead for both men. But until someone else rises up here and makes a compelling case otherwise, the collision course Nadal and Djokovic are on to meet in the French Open semifinals will be the day-in, day-out running narrative of this tournament. It is the storyline that has the potential to overshadow everything else, be it Serena Williams' historic attempt to tie Steffi Graf for the most major titles (22) in the Open era or the days-long tabloid drama about whether second-seeded Andy Murray and Amelie Mauresmo, a huge hero in here in her native France, did or didn't part ways on good terms as player and coach last month.

Nothing else here comes close to Djokovic versus Nadal for intrigue and star power, sentimental journeys and suspense.

The top-ranked Djokovic has won five of the past seven Grand Slam tournaments played, but for his career, he's 0-for-3 in French Open finals, losing a stunner last season to Stan Wawrinka that left him fighting back tears on the court. Like Pete Sampras, who also never won here at Roland Garros, or Bjorn Borg, who could never navigate the US Open, Djokovic's chase of his first French title has become a Sisyphean task.

Since arriving in Paris, he has tried his absolute best to downplay the urgency or pressure he's feeling. But few people believe him. When he looks back, the Wawrinka loss has to look like a golden opportunity missed, and when he looks ahead, he might once again have to get through Nadal to win here -- the same man who beat Djokovic in the other two finals he's lost at Roland Garros.

"People obviously wonder if this is the year [that will change] or not," Djokovic said after his win Tuesday. "I wonder myself. ... It is a particular sensation approaching this tournament. It's quite different than others. But, look, you know, it does depend on me how I'm going to use this emotion. So I try to use it as a motivation to inspire myself to play well, to stay calm and focus only on the present moment."

Nadal is taking the same approach.

If he wins his 10th title here, he would break a tie with Martina Navratilova for the most championships won at the same Grand Slam. But the Spanish star turns 30 next week, and what's shadowing him are far more unkind questions than the ones Djokovic is facing. The biggest one is this: If Nadal can't win another major title here at the tournament he owned for a decade, it is reasonable to ask if will he ever win another major anywhere?

Nadal is playing here to show his recent upswing on tour is no mirage. He has a chance to disprove the talk that all the grueling miles on his legs haven't made him old before his time. And his early returns Tuesday were encouraging. From the first ball hit, he walked around Suzanne-Lenglen Court as if he owned the joint again. He never took his foot off the gas from start to finish of his 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 dismantling of Groth. The strength of Groth's game is supposed to be his blistering serve, but Nadal handled even that -- then literally laughed when he showed up in the postmatch interview room and reporters ran out of questions for him within minutes because his dominance was that complete.

"Not much work today," Nadal joked, then directed the press officer to start taking questions in Spanish.

Djokovic took an only slightly more meandering path to his 6-4, 6-1, 6-1 win against Lu. Once Djokovic found his stride, he needed only 49 minutes to close out the last two sets.

Now, the hard part for everyone else -- if not Nadal and Djokovic -- is to avoid looking too far ahead and talking about nothing but the title or their possible semifinal.

Djokovic amiably said he can abstain.

Nadal was even more blunt. When a journalist asked him in Spanish if he believes he will win again here this year, Nadal shot back, "For sure, this is not the moment to talk about such things. No. This is not the time for that."
